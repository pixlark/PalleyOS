[X] Enable paging (A/P)
[ ] Agree upon a general memory map (A/P)
	- What is non-user-accessible (i.e. kernel code an data)
	- Where does stack begin, how big
	- Heap?
[X] Set up GDT (A/P)
	- Rather Straight forward, just set all descriptors and segmentation registers
	to use all of memory (probably). 0-4GiB. Alternatively, we can have ring 
	level 0 be one half and ring level 3 be the other half. CS and DS for kernel
	get one half and CS and DS for user get the other half.
[ ] Set up IDT (A/P)
   [ ] Detect if using PIC or APIC. Disable APIC and use PIC? (Might be easier)
   	   APIC is used for sending interrupts between processors (probably too advanced for right now)
[ ] Terminal output for the kernel (A)
[ ] Standard library
   [ ] printf (P)
   [ ] heap allocator (P)
[ ] Keyboard input (A)
[ ] Saving and loading to Disk ( )
