********** MUST DO BEFORE RUNNING ON HARDWARE **********
[ ] Update GDT so we can't write to BIOS memory



********** Kernel **********
[X] Enable paging (A/P)
	[X] Test Page Faults (P)

[X] Agree upon a general memory map (A/P)
	- What is non-user-accessible (i.e. kernel code an data)
	- Where does stack begin, how big
	- Heap?

[X] Set up GDT (A/P)
	- Rather Straight forward, just set all descriptors and segmentation registers
	to use all of memory (probably). 0-4GiB. Alternatively, we can have ring 
	level 0 be one half and ring level 3 be the other half. CS and DS for kernel
	get one half and CS and DS for user get the other half.

[X] Set up IDT (A/P)
   [ ] Detect if using PIC or APIC. Disable APIC and use PIC? (Might be easier)
   	   APIC is used for sending interrupts between processors (probably too advanced for right now)

[X] Standard library
   [X] printf (P)
   [X] heap allocator (P)

[X] Terminal output for the kernel (A)
	- Update to use a double buffer so that we don't have to stop for interrupts
	
[X] Keyboard input (A)
	- Add support for other scan sets?

[X] File I/O (A)
	[X] Saving and loading to Disk (A)

[X] Timer Interaction 
	[X] Sleep
	[ ] Callbacks?
	[ ] Read current timer Amt

[ ] Device Manager

[ ] Load Program from hard disk into memory and run
	- Later we will add support for processes which get their own stack and heap
	
[ ] Scheduler
	- Context Switching (TSS? Not sure what it is)
	- Most likely a simple round robin scheduler

[ ] Inter Process Communication
	- Send Messages between processes

[ ] USB Drivers

[ ] Go through and change all functions to camelCase

[ ] Move stack to its own region of memory! Right now it's tiny and in a bad place
